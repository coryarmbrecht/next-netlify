ARVADA learns a context-free grammar by building parse trees from the positive examples. Starting from initially flat trees, ARVADA builds structure to these trees with a key operation: it bubbles sequences of sibling nodes in the trees into a new node, adding a layer of indirection to the tree. Bubbling operations enable recursive generalization in the learned grammar. We evaluate ARVADA against GLADE and find it achieves on average increases of 4.98×in recall and 3.13×in F1 score, while incurring only a 1.27×slowdown and requiring only 0.87× as many calls to the oracle. ARVADA has a particularly\nmarked improvement over GLADE on grammars with highly recursive structure, like those of programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0veyzp/learning_highly_recursive_input","submitter_user":{"username":"vrthra","created_at":"2016-05-03T17:32:26.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Incoming lecturer (equivalent to an assistant prof. in the U.S.) at the University of Sydney\r\n\r\nhttp://rahul.gopinath.org\r\n\r\nTwitter: [@_rahulgopinath](https://twitter.com/_rahulgopinath)\r\n\r\n(I usually only browse lobste.rs and other social media on weekends.
